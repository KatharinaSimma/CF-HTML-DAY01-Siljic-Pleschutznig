	<h1>Song: Voices </h1>
	<h2>by In Flames</h2>
	<p> <i>Could you be the angel left in the dark?
<div>
	It's mostly silence echoing
Through the halls
Kill the hunt instead of lying to myself
For long I've seen the signs
Written on these walls
Written on these walls
</div>

<div>
	I will search, search through
The wreckage of my soul
Believe in what I have 'cause that's
That's all I am
That's all I am
</div>

<span>
	I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth
Reminding myself to breathe slow
Wandering alone in this wasteland
We used to call home
</span>


<div>
	Could you be the devil left in my heart?
All these feelings I wish I could turn them off
Kill the hunt instead of lying to myself
For long I've seen the signs
Written on these walls
Written on these walls
</div>

<span>
	I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth
Reminding myself to breathe slow
Wandering alone in this wasteland
We used to call home
</span>

<div>
	I will search, search through
The wreckage of my soul
Believe in what I have 'cause that's
That's all I am
</div>

<div>
	<span>
	I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth
Reminding myself to breathe slow
Wandering alone in this wasteland
We used to call home
We used to call home
I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth </i></p>
