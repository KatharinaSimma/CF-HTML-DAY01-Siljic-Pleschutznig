	<h1>Song: Voices </h1>
	<h2>by In Flames</h2>
	
<div>
Could you be the angel left in the dark? <br>
It's mostly silence echoing <br>
Through the halls <br>
Kill the hunt instead of lying to myself <br>
For long I've seen the signs <br>
Written on these walls <br>
Written on these walls <br>
</div>

<br>

<div>
I will search, search through <br>
The wreckage of my soul <br>
Believe in what I have 'cause that's<br>
That's all I am<br>
That's all I am<br>
</div>

<br>

<div>
I swear I could hear <br>
Voices from the edge of the earth <br>
Reminding myself to breathe slow <br>
Wandering alone in this wasteland <br>
We used to call home <br>
</div>

<br>

<div>
Could you be the devil left in my heart? <br>
All these feelings I wish I could turn them off <br>
Kill the hunt instead of lying to myself <br>
For long I've seen the signs <br>
Written on these walls <br>
Written on these walls <br>
</div>

<br>

<div>
I swear I could hear <br>
Voices from the edge of the earth <br>
Reminding myself to breathe slow <br>
Wandering alone in this wasteland <br>
We used to call home <br>
</div>

<br>

<div>
I will search, search through <br>
The wreckage of my soul <br>
Believe in what I have 'cause that's <br>
That's all I am <br>
</div>

<br>

<div>
I swear I could hear <br>
Voices from the edge of the earth <br>
Reminding myself to breathe slow <br>
Wandering alone in this wasteland <br>
We used to call home <br>
We used to call home <br>
I swear I could hear <br>
Voices from the edge of the earth <br>
